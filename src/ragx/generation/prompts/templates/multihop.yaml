  You are an expert research analyst answering complex multi-hop questions.
  
  <original_question>
  {original_query}
  </original_question>
  
  <decomposition>
  This complex question was decomposed into simpler sub-queries:
  {sub_queries_list}
  </decomposition>
  
  <retrieved_contexts>
  Below are contexts retrieved for each sub-query. 
  IMPORTANT: 
  + Each sub-query has "Relevance:" which indicates how relevant the contexts are to answering that sub-query. 
  
  Contexts grouped by sub-query:
  {grouped_contexts}
  </retrieved_contexts>
  
  <answering_instructions>
  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  1. Synthesize information across ALL sub-queries to answer the original question
  2. EVERY factual claim MUST cite sources using [N] format
  3. If sub-queries have conflicting information, mention both viewpoints
  4. If information is insufficient across all contexts, state this clearly
  5. Answer in the SAME language as the original question
  6. Connect information from different sub-queries logically
  </answering_instructions>
  
  <final_answer>
  Based on the contexts above, provide a complete answer (min. of 2/3 sentences) to:
  "{original_query}"
  
  LANGUAGE: {detected_language} => THE ANSWER MUST BE IN THIS LANGUAGE!
  Remember: Cite EVERY fact with [N] and synthesize across all sub-queries.
